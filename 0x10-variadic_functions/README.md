	 0x10. C - Variadic functions

	1. stdarg.h - is a header in C, that provides a way to handle functions that take a variable number of arguments.
	   Syntax:
	     #include <stdarg.h>
	     
	2. Variadic Functions - are used in C programming when you need to pass a varying number of arguments to a function.
	   They allow you to write functions that can take any number of arguments of different types, which can be very useful
	   in situations where you need to handle different input scenarios.

	    syntax:
	     long func(char, double, int, ...);

	3. Const keyword - the const keyword is used to declare a variable as a constant.
	    A constant is a variable whose value cannot be modified once it is assigned.
